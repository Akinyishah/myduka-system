#FLASK-its a framework used to build an application
#what is a framework-software used to build web applications e.g FLASK,DJANGO,FASTAPI-python frameworks 
    .NET-C#
    Spring-Java
    Ruby on Rails-Ruby
    we use Frameworks on top of languages 
    Comes with ready made tools for you to build applications 

#flask framework-is an application programming interface that allows us to build web applications 
using python. Flask is often classified as a micro-framework,because it does not require  particular tools and library to function.  


#what is a library and examples of library 
    this is a pre-written code that helps solves specific problems or adds certain features 
    #concept of building a house:-
    OPTION1-this is the library
    -identigy land,identify requirements,design the house,go the hardware, 
    Library is a like a store that has hammer,nails,wood,ironsheet
    with library the programmer is in control of usage.


    OPTION2-This is the framework
    -Go to an engineer and architect and get a predesigned(blueprint) house with all the tools and 
    materials alreday identified and provided
    -with Framework its structured hence the programmer
    has to follow a certain conventions and practices to achieve desired goal
#difference between a framework and a library
    -with Framework its structured hence the programmer
    has to follow a certain conventions and practices to achieve desired goal WHILE LIBRARY
    -Library is a like a store that has hammer,nails,wood,ironsheet
    with library the programmer is in control of usage.


#ROUTING- Mechanism used to map URLs to view functions -system for resource navigation.
#what is a route
Definition-part of the URL that determines what functions to
            execute when a specific URL is accessed or visited 

www.myduka.com-this is the URL
www.myduka/products.com-this is now a route where resources being provided here are only about products            

#HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT ROUTING IN FLASK?
@app.route()- this is a decorator :function that allows you to modify the behaviour of other functions
BELOW ARE EXAMPLES 

@app.route('/products)
def products():
    products=fetch_data('productd')
    return products


@app.route('/login)
def login():    

#In summary, in Flask, a decorator like @app.route() is a Python mechanism used to map URLs to view functions, 
#enabling the framework to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler functions.

#PARARAMETERS THAT CAN BE PASSED IN A ROUTE FUNCTION-decorator
1.Rule- e.g /, /products,/sales,/users- This defines the path a user accesses the browser(index.html is / only at the begining)
